Welcome to the Group of Multimedia. Our group was established in the Computer Science and Technology Department of Tianjin University. Researchers of our group mainly investigate scientific principles and practical applications of computer vision, including visual reasoning, image captioning, movie Q&A, reinforcement learning and adversarial machine learning. The emphasis of our work is on multimedia systems that are capable of understanding, interpreting and reasoning from multi-modal data.

We have published articles at many top conferences and journals in the field of computer vision, such as ACM MM, AAAI, IJCAI, T-IP etc. We have also achieved good results in many competitions, the 1st in the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC 2017), 2nd in Video to Language Challenge (2017) hosted by Microsoft Research Asia and 3rd in the first Large Scale Image Retrieval Competition organized by Alibaba (2015) etc.

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students and Master students to join the team !** <br>
