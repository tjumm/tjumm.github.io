# Overview

Our research primarily focuses on fundamental theories and key technologies in artificial intelligence and computer vision, with an emphasis on intelligent perception and embodied intelligence in open and complex environments. Our goal is to move beyond traditional static visual understanding paradigms and advance intelligent systems from passive perception toward autonomous agents capable of cognition, decision-making, and action.
In recent years, our research has centered on open-world visual understanding and 3D environmental perception, aiming to systematically investigate perception, reasoning, and decision-making mechanisms of intelligent agents operating in real-world dynamic environments. Our research topics include autonomous driving perception and scene understanding, embodied navigation and interactive learning, 3D visual perception and scene modeling, multimodal vision–language understanding, and unified Vision–Language–Action modeling frameworks. These efforts seek to enable intelligent systems to achieve continual generalization and adaptive capability under unseen environments and distribution shifts.
In parallel, we study the reliability and interpretability of deep learning models, with particular attention to generalization mechanisms in open environments, out-of-distribution robustness, and trustworthy learning principles. By integrating representation learning, causal reasoning, and structured modeling, we aim to understand the underlying behavioral mechanisms of intelligent models from a theoretical perspective and provide methodological foundations for building generalizable, interpretable, and reliable intelligent perception systems.

  <h5><b>1 VGGDrive: Empowering Vision-Language Models with Cross-View Geometric Grounding for Autonomous Driving</b></h5>
  <p>Jie Wang, Guang Li, Zhijian Huang, Chenxu Dang, Hangjun Ye, Yahong Han, Long Chen<br>CVPR 2026,<br>Cross-view 3D geometric modeling is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing Vision–Language Models (VLMs) lack explicit geometric reasoning capability, resulting in limited performance in complex driving scenarios. Current auxiliary training strategies based on Q&A supervision attempt to alleviate this issue but fail to fundamentally address the absence of geometric grounding.
To overcome this limitation, we propose VGGDrive, an architecture that equips VLMs with cross-view geometric grounding by leveraging mature 3D foundation models. A plug-and-play Cross-View 3D Geometric Enabler (CVGE) is introduced to bridge 3D spatial representations and 2D visual features without altering the original VLM structure. Extensive experiments on five autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating 3D foundation models for geometry-aware autonomous driving.

  <h5><b>2 Towards Open Environments and Instructions: General Vision-Language Navigation via Fast-Slow Interactive Reasoning</b></h5>
  <p>Yang Li, Aming WU, Zihao Zhang, Yahong Han<br>CVPR 2026,<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09111'>(Preprint)</a>, <a href='https://github.com/yl6017339/Slow4Fast-VLN'>(Project Page)</a> <br> We focus on the GSA-VLN task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning, it continually improves the generalization ability of fast decisions.

  <h5><b>1 Geometric-Aware Hypergraph Reasoning for Novel Class Discovery in Point Cloud Segmentation</b></h5>
  <p>Zihao Zhang, Yang Li, Aming Wu, Yahong Han, Jialie Shen<br>CVPR 2026<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13307'>(Preprint)</a>, <a href='https://github.com/Brucely674/Causal-3D-NCDSS'>(Project Page)</a> <br>Novel Class Discovery in Point Cloud Segmentation has recently attracted increasing attention, aiming to leverage knowledge from known classes to automatically discover and segment unlabeled novel categories in point clouds. The key challenge lies in effectively transferring both geometric and semantic knowledge from multiple known classes to enable reliable understanding of unseen categories. However, existing methods mainly rely on pairwise associations for class assignment and reasoning, overlooking higher-order relationships among classes. Such binary modeling limits the ability to capture complex inter-class dependencies, often resulting in ambiguous semantic predictions for novel classes. To address this issue, we introduce a hypergraph structure to explicitly model high-order associations, enabling collaborative reasoning from multiple known classes toward novel categories. In addition, prior approaches tend to emphasize semantic features while underutilizing geometric information, whereas our method jointly exploits geometric and semantic cues to achieve more accurate and robust novel class segmentation.

To address this, we propose imposing causal relationships as strong constraints to uncover class-aligned essential point cloud representations. We introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to redefine the 3D-NCD problem and present a new method: Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, the method uses SCM to analyze hidden confounders in base class representations and causal links between base and novel classes; designs a causal representation prototype to eliminate confounders and capture base classes’ causal representations; and employs a graph to model causal relationships between base class causal prototypes and novel class prototypes, enabling base-to-novel causal reasoning.

  <p>Deng Li, Aming Wu, Yang Li, Yaowei Wang, Yahong Han<br>ICCV 2025,<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24063'>(Preprint)</a> <br>Environments change over time and space, challenging object detectors trained on a closed-set assumption, where training and test data share the same distribution. To address this, continual test-time adaptation has emerged, aiming to fine-tune specific parameters (e.g., BatchNorm) to improve generalization. However, fine-tuning a few parameters may degrade the representation of others, leading to performance issues. We propose a new approach that converts fine-tuning into specific-parameter generation. Our method uses a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware adapter that separates features into domain-invariant and domain-specific components for efficient adaptation. We also introduce a conditional diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism to synthesize adapter parameters based on the current environment, avoiding local optima. Lastly, a class-centered optimal transport alignment is used to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Additionally, it exposes the model to a broader range of style features with different data distributions, thereby enhancing its generalization capability in unseen domains. The significant performance gains over five adverse-weather scenarios and the Real to Art benchmark demonstrate the superiorities of our method.</p>

These vehicles rely on vision and LiDAR sensors for 3D perception, but adversarial vulnerabilities can mislead these systems, endangering safety. While existing research focuses on 2D-pixel image attacks, these lack real-world applicability in 3D. To address this, we propose AdvNeRF, a novel approach for generating 3D adversarial meshes targeting both vision and LiDAR models. AdvNeRF leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to create high-quality adversarial objects, ensuring robustness across multiple viewpoints. Experimental results show that AdvNeRF significantly degrades 3D object detectors, highlighting its potential to compromise autonomous vehicle perception systems from various perspectives. This marks a key advancement in 3D adversarial attacks.

We reveal the relationship between current noise and variance of sampling, the monotonicity of noise compression in decision-based attack, as well as the influence of transition function on the convergence of decision-based attack. Guided by the new framework and theoretical analysis, we propose a black-box adversarial attack named Customized Iteration and Sampling Attack (CISA). CISA estimates the distance from nearby decision boundary to set the stepsize, and uses a dual-direction iterative trajectory to find the intermediate adversarial example. Based on the intermediate adversarial example, CISA conducts customized sampling according to the noise sensitivity of each pixel to further compress noise, and relaxes the state transition function to achieve higher query efficiency.</p>

PAR divides images into patches through a coarse-to-fine search process and compresses the noise on each patch separately. PAR records the noise magnitude and noise sensitivity of each patch and selects the patch with the highest query value for noise compression. In addition, PAR can be used as a noise initialization method for other decision-based attacks to improve the noise compression efficiency on both ViTs and CNNs without introducing additional calculations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that PAR achieves a much lower noise magnitude with the same number of queries.</p>

We further reveal the relationship between the initial noise and the compressed noise in boundary attack. We propose Customized Adversarial Boundary (CAB) attack that uses the current noise to model the sensitivity of each pixel and polish adversarial noise of each image with a customized sampling setting. On the one hand, CAB uses current noise as a prior belief to customize the multivariate normal distribution. On the other hand, CAB keeps the new samplings away from historical failed queries to avoid similar mistakes. Experimental results measured on several image classification datasets emphasizes the validity of our method.</p>

To tackle this, we propose Behavior-Contextualized Item Preference Modeling (BCIPM), which learns specific item preferences within each behavior and only considers relevant preferences for the target behavior. Auxiliary behaviors are used for training, refining the learning process without affecting target behavior accuracy. Additionally, pre-training initial embeddings enriches item-aware preferences, especially when target behavior data is sparse.
